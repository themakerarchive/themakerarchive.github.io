DAY  1
Three hours, three different toolsâ€“a good initial dose for an absolute novice trying to get acquainted with a new craft. So how does a person who barely adorns herself with jewellery end up trading Saturday sleep-ins for a few hours on a jewellerâ€™s bench each week? I wonder, too.

The first lesson was all about familiarising ourselves with the most basic of tools, exercising safety precautions, as well as finding methods that worked best for us as individuals; at the same time, they had to be effective and efficient.

Without further ado, here is an overview of my first three hours divided into tool types:

Piercing Saw. I handled this tool with an eager hand and newfound enthusiasm, only to be told I was â€˜too intenseâ€™. The key, according to our instructor, is to grip it firmly but gently; that we should ease our way into the brass metal sheet with long, consistent strokes.

Despite constant hammering reverberating from the floor above and a surround-sound of saw blades grating against metal, the simple act of cutting straight lines created a mental space for meditative purposes. They werenâ€™t merely annoying aural stimuli. On the contrary, the noises seemed to have independently composed themselves into a strange yet comforting rhythm which I found myself wanting to harmonise with. And harmonise I did.

Damage: At least five broken saw blades.
Causes: Vigorous sawing and inexperienced manoeuvring of angles

Centre Punch. Primarily used for making impressions on metal surfaces, either for decorative or practical purposes. It aids in stabilising the drill bit â€“ avoiding slippages, unwanted marks, and accidents.

Damage: None, happily.

Rotary Tool. In conjunction with a drill bit, we used it to make holes in the negative spaces within the butterfly. These holes are the starting points from which we cut them out completely with a piercing saw.

Damage: A few slips here and there. (Notice the markings around the holes.)
Causes: Personal apprehensions. Now is a good time to confess that, prior to this lesson, I had never used a drill â€“ nor saw, for that matter â€“ of any kind in the entirety of my existence.

For the most part, sawing curvy lines gave me less anxiety and I do believe my performance was much better in that regard. Another explanation is increased confidence with the piercing saw. Either of which are minuscule improvements, but one must learn to celebrate minor achievements in order to retain a positive outlook. As well as that, mastery of a skill takes hours and hours of dedication so whining about unmet self-expectations seems rather unbecoming ðŸ™‚

On the other hand, I stepped into that class as a humble receptacle for new knowledge. I have made a conscious effort to actively observe what works and what doesnâ€™t, as well as acknowledge constructive criticisms dealt against me.
