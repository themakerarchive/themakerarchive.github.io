The presence of something new is certainly a double-edged sword. It provides a great deal of excitement, though it could also veil our perception with the impression that everything is going to be different ‘this time’ around. Which was exactly the case when I enrolled myself into an introductory course on silversmithing earlier this year.

I’d mistakenly thought it would provide some much-needed motivation that would finally allow me to create some content. I schemed and vowed to document everything I learned in class, yet Saturdays came and went and now two months have passed since the course came to an end. Such is the way of life. Plans have a surreptitious way of unravelling and, sometimes, even as they dangle by a thread, we hang onto our stubborn, obsolete ways – refusing to see and approach things from vantage points different from our own.

My mind, however, has become increasingly suffused with the idea that, perhaps, restructuring and a bit of leniency is key. My expectations have been toned down to realistic levels and I no longer feel tied to pre-existing ideals I’d set for myself.

Still, I feel a sense of duty that I would like to honour and that includes writing an overview of each project undertaken throughout the entirety of my silversmithing course.

Project 1/3: Butterfly Pendant

Following some basic piercing and drilling exercises, we were each given a butterfly printout glued onto a sheet of brass. This is a simple project that opened my eyes to the magical process of creating a piece of jewellery – from the less than glamorous but necessary job of filing a piece of metal to smooth perfection, down to greasy polishing, and, finally, supersonic cleansing. Despite having a cool attitude, this surprisingly took longest to finish – most probably due to a general lack of skill.

Along the way, I realised that:

1. Jewellery-making shows no mercy even to the most hardworking hands
2. Speed greatly decreases accuracy, which makes filing a living hell as I reshape instead of smoothen the edges
3. I wouldn’t have finished with a decent piece if it wasn’t for our instructor’s persistent yet always constructive array of criticisms
4. This butterfly taught me patience and has re-calibrated my eye to filter possible imperfections
5. It’s the perfect hobby/career for someone who likes small-scale dirty work and is a stickler for details
6. I am attracted to the idea of being able to render something in metal based solely on my own imaginings

The truth is so few things in life have managed to hold my interest for extended periods of time, so therein lies the appeal. Overall it is a strange place to be in – being in between strong feelings of positivity and an underlying concern that I may never truly excel at it. But it is actions, not thoughts, that affect outcome and provide answers. One should only persevere and exercise patience in order to get there.
