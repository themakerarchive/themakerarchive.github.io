Despite my brief yet undoubtedly eye-opening foray into the world of jewellery making, I still find it hard to soften the disconnect between walking into a jewellery shop and working at a jewellerâ€™s bench. Itâ€™s as though my mind refuses to collate these two things which are clearly two ends of a spectrum. (Iâ€™m sure my mind will get around to it eventually!)

It is also for this exact same reason that handling a piece of metal as they come from bullion suppliers doesnâ€™t stir the same feelings of reverence conjured up when I wear or hold a dainty piece of jewellery. It feels all too casual, but most notable is the absence of fear â€“ of somehow devaluing the craftsmanship ingrained in a piece, made precious with sweat and possibly a few drops of tears. Still, having the ability â€“ however limited my skills are â€“ to work from scratch, there is an omnipresent feeling of unease that I might somehow fail to treat raw materials with the veneration they deserve.

The necklace pictured above is the finished product from our second project: a bezel-set pendant, which I wrote about in my previous post.

The second photo is of sterling silver covered in protective film â€“ not glamorous at all, donâ€™t you agree? Itâ€™s 12Ã—12 cm and bought with unwavering enthusiasm, only to later realise itâ€™s probably not a good idea to practice with considering I have no means to melt and cast metal into ingots. For the time being, Iâ€™ll stick with brass. ðŸ™‚
