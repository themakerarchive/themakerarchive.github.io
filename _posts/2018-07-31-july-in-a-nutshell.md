    Before and after: from wire to ring.

July is the month majority of the tools I had ordered online arrived. Slowly, one by one, they are each finding a suitable and semi-permanent space to inhabit near my workspace (i.e. the kitchen), subsequently and exponentially expanding the scope of my experiments in ways even I have yet to find out. While this is in no way an implication that I have perfected the art of piercing and filing, I also feel it will be beneficial to learn a few things at once. We all have our own unique approach and switching it up is one of the things that helps sustain my willingness to finish a job.

The decision to purchase a torch was only a natural progression in the learning process, of course. Towards the end of the introductory course, I was given the opportunity to learn either wax carving or soldering – I chose the former, and then switched to soldering when I realised it would be more beneficial to me as someone who planned on playing with fire at home but had also never handled a torch. It used to scare me, so the experience gave me a much-needed shot of confidence.

Looking back, I derived much enjoyment from making a ring so I thought I’d make it my first soldering project. Only upon commencement did I realise I was missing one crucial tool necessary for forging it into its ‘true shape’, but that’s how I’ve been getting on these past few weeks! Buying as necessary. Taking it slow has probably saved me from useless purchases, despite it not being the most efficient way to shop.

I was so eager to get started that I started mentally gathering some of the tips I read online. In retrospect there’s a lot of things I could’ve done differently, but, in summary: my first project was a success! It’s true, experience is the best teacher. Prior to starting out I futilely worried about the silver solder showing through. “Is there a more appropriate type for brass? What if the silver solder shows through? How will I get rid of the excess?” were some of the questions that plagued my novice mind.

I later discovered the answers when I embarked on my second project – by being observant and combining practice with a fair bit of research. I didn’t learn every single thing, but I certainly knew more compared to my first attempt.

Small progress is progress. It counts. Next up? A pair of hoop earrings.

Until then!
