  <br>Listed below are the teas you received ordered from Berlin-based tea retailer  [Paper & Tea](https://www.paperandtea.com/) ,
  <br>provided with brewing receommendations as printed on the packaging. I did a write-up for 
  <br>each of them comprising some of the things I learned in my own time – just click on the   <br>names if you fancy reading more!

<b>Kukicha (Organic)*</b>
  <br>Origin: Mie, Japan 
  <br>Temperature: 60-70°C 
  <br>Leaf-Water Ratio: 1.5 tsp/250 ml 
  <br>4 brewings, in sec: 60/30/40/90

<b>Pu-Er Bai Ya</b>
  <br>Origin: Yunnan, China
  <br>Temperature: 80°C 
  <br>Leaf-Water Ratio: 2tsp/250ml 
  <br>4 brewings, in sec: 60/40/60/90 

<b>Long Jing</b>
  <br>Origin: Zhejiang, China 
  <br>Temperature: 70-80°C 
  <br>Leaf-Water Ratio: 2tsp/250ml 
  <br>3 brewings, in sec: 90/40/60 
<br>
<br><b>*</b>Knowing it was sourced from a small tea garden in Mie Prefecture, I decided to conduct my own research to see if I
  <br>could trace it back to the farmer. Though based only on circumstantial evidence I strongly believe this to be a product of
  <br>[Iwao Hayashi](http://marimo.eu/tag/iwao-hayashi), a farmer who’s been spearheading organic tea cultivation in Japan as far back as forty years ago! Isn’t that
  <br>impressive?
