January: a month of firsts, and of pledge renewals from New Year’s past. Ja-new-ary. Now that’s an alternative spelling befitting its origin. Did you know January comes comes from the Latin word ianua, meaning door or gate? I didn’t, but a quick Google search will easily tell you that. When I feel I’m scraping the bottom of a barrel for writing inspiration, I choose a word and look it up in the dictionary – a practice which enables me to approach a topic or idea from another angle.

The truth is I’ve been making all kinds of excuses not to open my laptop, though the hankering to honour a pact made between myself and a cousin who, same as me, is striving to write more, is one I can’t ignore. Although this past week has seen more inspiration compared to the first half of the month, I’m not a person who writes on a regular basis, nor do I consider myself particularly adroit, and so the pen isn’t a weapon I brandish with full confidence. Writing doesn’t come easy these days. But I digress.

The word door may be perfect, if not overly clichéd, as far as New Year symbolisms go, but resolution-making as an annual ritual is something I do not partake in.

Why?

I am of the belief that the desire to better oneself should spring from within – as a natural response to our own personal life events, not a bandwagon we jump on once a year solely because it’s a widely-accepted practice. All we need is a wee bit of mindfulness; the ability to recognise our spiritual and intellectual needs, and be able to identify elements that no longer serve us. All of which are equally important as our desire for change.

Intentional or not, change is inevitable and happen a lot more than we realise. Slowly, I’m learning to embrace it all – the good, the bad – armed with the confidence that I’ll be able to filter whatever is necessary to propel me forward. Though I say I’ve always known this, I think I finally understand the importance of getting involved in something beyond anything that guarantees an ego stroke (at least as it relates to me); of diving headfirst into unchartered territory. It is journeys to the unknown where I find myself with peculiar observations and realisations which, though odd, feel right and tie in well with the rest of my being.

This is far from a criticism, of course. I only stress the importance of intention, of understanding the reasons why we believe in or do the things we do. In fact, I would like to publicly acknowledge my own achievements last week – nothing monumental by any means, but milestones nonetheless:

1) Running. The thought of chasing my own breath is enough to make me not want to run, but I’ve had an average weight gain of two kilograms a month up from forty-three to fifty-one. I’m not a person overly concerned with numbers, but I know my body. I know when I abuse it, and take action as needed. All throughout last week I tried desperately to haul my toasty bum out of bed at six am. On Friday: a success.

2) Yoga. Thanks to a friend who successfully encouraged me to start practicing yoga with a lovely mat and an array of Youtube channel recommendations. Two days in and I’m enjoying it in a way I never used to.

3) Jewellery skills. For the first time this year and in a very long time, I picked up my trusty saw. I picked it up and started cutting triangular shapes in brass with no specific design in mind. As they increased in number, so did my ideas – a good reminder that I must keep on going despite creative block.

I’ll be writing more in the next few days. For now, time to make use of my nearly-depleted willpower on the yoga mat.
