As silversmithing progressively drew more and more attention from me, the less I took photographs. Besides, my fingers were consistently grubby with metal particles, polishing compounds, etc. When you’re fully immersed in something, it’s hard to do much else! I begrudgingly took the compulsory tea breaks, even though I thoroughly enjoyed the socialisation aspect of it.

I haven’t blogged in a while and I’m still feeling my way in, figuring out the best way to position photos in my blog posts. Anyway, I came up with a temporary fix to do a collage in order to show some of the steps involved in the making of this stone set pendant.

We were advised to pick a round stone as opposed to oval as it’s easier to shape. I have yet to attempt an oval setting so I can’t say more, but some decided to take on the challenge and ended up with a round bezel. Amongst the students who played it safe there was one who forged a perfectly round bezel on one side, but disappointingly oval on the other. *Cough*

But I digress.

    Before and after: from wire to ring.

Here is a quick rundown, from L-R:

1. As you can see we were working with a fairly small amount of silver. There was actually plenty left over, which I’d slipped into my apron pocket and lost forever! With the aid of callipers and a divider, we were able to precisely cut a strip and bend it around with some pliers in order to fit the stone. “It needs to sit without falling through or much of the surface protruding at the top,” was what our instructor said.Despite having to anneal and enlarge the setting, it turned out to be a much quicker process than I’d originally expected and was able to finish it in one sitting.
2. What the stone looks sitting on the bezel. I’m sure I could’ve done more, but as we were working under a limited time frame there wasn’t much opportunity to perfect the technique.
3. The next step was to cut another strip for the second component: a bail. The idea is to bend it into the shape of a horseshoe, cut a V shape on both sides and make sure they align. One of the challenges I grappled with working on this particular piece was asymmetry; each side needed to be aligned, or at least needed to look like they were.
4. This photo was taken during the school’s mid-term break, when I decided to get my very own piercing saw as well as a few files to get me going for a couple of weeks. There was nothing much left to do with it, except obsess over its visual balance.
5. In which our instructor forced me to look closer and see a subtle malformation. Indeed, the tips of my bail were not level! She assured me I had lots of material to work with so file away I did.
6. The day two became one. It was also the day I finally slipped it into a small ziplock bag so they could send it to a professional stone setter. HURRAH! I was glad to part, at least temporarily, with a pendant I wasn’t particularly fond of.

I need to disclose that soldering wasn’t a part of this introductory course so I wouldn’t be so bold as to take full credit. My instructor did encourage us to observe, which I took full advantage of. I do wish I’d taken more and better photos, but I promise to make more of an effort in the future!
