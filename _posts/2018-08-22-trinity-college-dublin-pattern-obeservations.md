Apart from cafes, Trinity College must be second on my list of most popular meet-up points. As a former student of the university, it was a no-brainer of course. 

Architecturally speaking, there is plenty to marvel at; it is centrally located and an inspiring environment to immerse oneself in. It is also a great place to sketch and people-watch, which is exactly what a dear friend and I have been doing recently even though 90% of our meet-ups consist of exchanging gossip instead of graciously gliding our pencils on the pages of our sketchbooks. ðŸ™‚
