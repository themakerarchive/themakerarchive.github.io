I have a confession to make: prior to my attendance of a silversmithing course, I had never once thought of metal crafts as something I would personally enjoy. In fact, it was one of the options I automatically relegated to my mental list of ‘Least Interesting Courses’ whenever I pored over college prospectuses. “It’s all manual, frivolous work,” I thought, instantly closing a door of opportunities for a long time to come—opportunities that may, or also may not have, expedited my journey of self-exploration.

I grew up in a society and time where traditional craft was undoubtedly prevalent, but not fashionable; where the word lokal carried a negative connotation, and where artisans responsible for the magnificent plethora of intricate woodcuts and colourful handwoven textiles that adorned the pavements were hardly celebrated as masters. In truth, they were often stereotyped as impoverished members of minorities that couldn’t afford, or were lacking the requisite skills needed, to swap their trade for more financially-lucrative career options.

As westernisation pervasively swept across our little archipelago, these crafts, too, increasingly paled in comparison to the big brands of our cousins across the Pacific. As ashamed as I am to admit, I myself wasn’t immune to this imposing influence. I grew up patronising other cultures but my own.

And though it’s hard to say with certainty, I believe it’s the accumulation of guilt from my upbringing—at least in part—that is responsible for a heightened desire to rediscover my cultural roots through craft, in the process forever changing the way I perceive people and things that surround me.

Taking the time to learn about the long and arduous processes involved behind products that we, as consumers, buy helps us better understand and assess their true value. Some choose to go down a path of indifference despite unfortunate realisations, while others, perhaps shackled by economic limitations or some other, find a way to perform a self-imposed duty to teach others through the propagation of lessons learned from their own revelatory experiences.

What you see in the photo is a 20×40 mm sheet of silver—before I began the process of piercing, forging, filing, and polishing; before it metamorphosed into a more recognisable form that inspires wonder and leaves an onlooker positively awestruck. Indeed, it’s precious metal and, yes, it’s pricey (still relatively cheap compared to gold, platinum, etc.), but handling it for the first time was surprisingly underwhelming.

However, one must remember that its beauty is not something immediately apparent. No—it lies within the possibilities running amok in the mind of a maker.
